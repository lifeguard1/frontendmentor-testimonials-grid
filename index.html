          <h3>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h3>
          
          <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br>
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

          <h3>The team was very <br> supportive and kept me <br> motivated</h3>

          <p>“ I started as a total newbie with <br> virtually no coding skills. I now work <br> as a mobile engineer 
            for a big <br> company. This was one of the best <br> investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

            <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
            learning from <br> their experiences was easy.
          </h3>

          <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program 
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable 
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br> personal attention you need from 
            an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

            <h3>Such a life-changing <br> experience. Highly <br> recommended!</h3>

          <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
            professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
            student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
            did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
            project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial 
            could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent 
            experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 
            100% recommend! ”</p>
